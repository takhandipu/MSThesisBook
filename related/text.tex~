Traditional analog model for spectrum management resulted into the inefficient utilization of most radio frequency spectrum~\cite{valenta2010survey}. While several mobile network spectrum bands are highly congested, other spectrums bands like TV space and non-commercial radio bands are overly under-utilized. Moreover, these utilization varies depending on time and place resulting into spectrum hole~\cite{tandra2009spectrum}. Subsequently, the notion of cognitive radio was proposed to exploit these temporal and spatial
