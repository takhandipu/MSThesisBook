\chapter{Conclusion}
Cognitive radio networks suffer noteworthy throughput degradation with the introduction of multi-radio usage. We propose a feedback-based multi-radio exploitation approach for CRNs in this thesis to overcome this throughput degradation. We implement the proposed approach in ns-3 to measure various performance metrics such as throughput, delay, packet delivery, and drop ratio over numerous network settings. Simulation results reveal that our proposed approach can significantly increase total network throughput and decrease packet drop ratio compared to other existing techniques. Furthermore, the feedback-based approach can be used to find the number of radios needed to experience a delicate tradeoff between network throughput and delay for applications maintaining different data rates. In future, we plan to formulate analytical models of our proposed approach and implement the approach in real testbed.
