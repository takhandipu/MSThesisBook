\chapter{Future Work}
We tried our best to perform extensive simulations to validate our proposed approach. However, we are aware of the limitations of simulation. At this time, we do not have any access to a real CR testbed. In future, we plan to validate our presented simulation model with CR testbed. We also plan to formulate analytical models in future. We will model the successful packet transmission probability and PU-free channel selection probability. From these two models, we will formulate the delay and throughput for the proposed MRCRNs architecture. Our proposed approach exploits multiple radios traversing multiple channels at the same time. However, multi-path communication via multiple cognitive radios would be another interesting field to study. In future, we would investigate the performance of CMRNs exploiting multi-path communication.
