abstract={We analyze the multihop delay of ad hoc cognitive radio networks, where the transmission delay of each hop consists of the propagation delay and the waiting time for the availability of the communication channel (i.e. the occurrence of a spectrum opportunity at this hop). Using theories and techniques from continuum percolation and ergodicity, we establish the scaling law of the minimum multihop delay with respect to the source-destination distance in cognitive radio networks. When the propagation delay is negligible, we show the starkly different scaling behavior of the minimum multihop delay in instantaneously connected networks as compared to networks that are only intermittently connected due to scarcity of spectrum opportunities. Specifically, if the network is instantaneously connected, the minimum multihop delay is asymptotically independent of the distance; if the network is only intermittently connected, the minimum multihop delay scales linearly with the distance. When the propagation delay is nonnegligible but small, we show that although the scaling order is always linear, the scaling rate for an instantaneously connected network can be orders of magnitude smaller than the one for an intermittently connected network.},

abstract={Cognitive radio networks will provide high bandwidth to mobile users via heterogeneous wireless architectures and dynamic spectrum access techniques. However, CR networks impose challenges due to the fluctuating nature of the available spectrum, as well as the diverse QoS requirements of various applications. Spectrum management functions can address these challenges for the realization of this new network paradigm. To provide a better understanding of CR networks, this article presents recent developments and open research issues in spectrum management in CR networks. More specifically, the discussion is focused on the development of CR networks that require no modification of existing networks. First, a brief overview of cognitive radio and the CR network architecture is provided. Then four main challenges of spectrum management are discussed: spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing, and spectrum mobility.},

abstract={Opportunistic unlicensed access to the (temporarily) unused frequency bands across the licensed radio spectrum is currently being investigated as a means to increase the efficiency of spectrum usage. Such opportunistic access calls for implementation of safeguards so that ongoing licensed operations are not compromised. Among different candidates, sensing-based access, where the unlicensed users transmit if they sense the licensed band to be free, is particularly appealing due to its low deployment cost and its compatibility with the legacy licensed systems. The ability to reliably and autonomously identify unused frequency bands is envisaged as one of the main functionalities of cognitive radios. In this article we provide an overview of the regulatory requirements and major challenges associated with the practical implementation of spectrum sensing functionality in cognitive radio systems. Furthermore, we outline different design trade-offs that have to be made in order to enhance various aspects of the system's performance.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the performance gains of cognitive radio relay networks under delay quality of service (QoS) limitations at the secondary users, and spectrum-sharing restrictions imposed by the primary users of the channel. In particular, we assume that the primary user allows secondary users to gain access to its allocated spectrum band as long as a certain threshold on its corresponding outage probability is satisfied. Using this constraint, we find the maximum limit on the interference-power inflicted on the primary receiver that should not be exceeded by the transmission of the secondary users. In addition, we assume that the secondary transmitter benefits from an intermediate node, chosen from K terminals, to relay its signal to the destination. Considering that the transmission of the secondary user is subject to satisfying a statistical delay QoS constraint, we obtain the maximum arrival-rate supported by the secondary user's relaying link. In this respect, we derive closed-form expressions for the effective capacity of the channel in Rayleigh block-fading environment. Numerical simulations are provided to endorse our theoretical results.},
